        PYroMat is a flexible platform for conveniently working with thermodynamic data.  The expanding collection of substances includes data for the properties people need most, exposed in an intuitively designed object interface [Come read more.](pyromat.org)
        
        ## Installation from the Python Package Index
        If you have pip installed, you can install PYroMat with a single command.
        ```
        $ pip install pyromat 
        ```
        If you are upgrading, you can always use
        ```
        $ pip install pyromat --upgrade
        ```
        
        ## Getting started
        ```python
        >>> import pyromat as pm
        >>> O2 = pm.get('ig.O2')
        >>> h = O2.h(492,1.01)  # enthalpy at 492K, 1.01bar
        >>> pm.info('O2')     # where did these data come from?
        >>> pm.config['unit_pressure'] = 'psi'  # Don't like working in bar?
        ```
        
        Happy calculating!
